# Hi, Iâ€™m MattÃ©o Bevilacqua ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in **Mathematical Engineering (Statistical Learning track)** at Politecnico di Milano, with a background from **Ã‰cole Centrale de Lyon** and classes prÃ©paratoires at **LycÃ©e Louis-le-Grand (MPSI/MP)**.  

My topics of interest include machine learning, data science and statistics, with growing interest in system building (software engineering, MLOps...).
